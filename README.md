# High-b-value-DWI-denoising
Deep learning based denoising can improve signal-to-noise ratio in high b-value diffusion imaging with reduced acquisition time. We applied deep learning based denoising method on retrospective and prospective high b-value DWI. Unsharp masking used during testing to emphasize medium contrast details.
